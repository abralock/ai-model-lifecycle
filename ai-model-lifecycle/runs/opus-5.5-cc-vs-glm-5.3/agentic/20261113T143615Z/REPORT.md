# Agentic runs — opus-5.5-cc-vs-glm-5.3 · run 20261113T143615Z

The model works on a copy of the project inside a sandbox with an agent (Claude Code for Claude models, opencode for open-weight models): edit, build, test, fix, until its `/goal` is met or the time limit is hit; what it delivered is then scored by the case's acceptance check, including hidden tests it never saw. Infra errors (the session never ran) are left out.
